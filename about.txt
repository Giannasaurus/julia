# This is supposed to be a sankey diagram in mermaid.
  What happened was:
  Following Mermaid's syntax on Sankey [[https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sankey.html]],
  I wanted to experiment and uploaded the code on VS Code.
  I tried saving it, apparently Windows doesn't have the .mmd extension on default.
  The file extension suddenly changed to .jl, probably to accommodate the incompatibility of my file.
  (Julia rabbit hole)

## What I learned:
  * julia repl
  * cd("path\to\julia\file")
  * include("julia-file.jl")
  * installing packages
  * csv stuff
