# This is supposed to be a sankey diagram in mermaid.
  What happened was:
  Following Mermaid's syntax on Sankey [[https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sankey.html]],
  I wanted to experiment and uploaded the code on VS Code.
  I tried saving it, apparently Windows doesn't have the .mmd extension on default.
  The file extension suddenly changed to .jl, which was probably the most compatible for my file.
  (Julia rabbit hole)

## What I learned:
  * julia repl
  * cd("path\to\julia\file")
  * include("julia-file.jl")
  * installing packages
  * csv stuff
